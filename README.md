#Group Members: 
	Yoon Choi, Davis Gossage, Keng Low, Eirika Sawh


#Date Started and Finished: 
	September 29 - October 26
##Estimate Number of Hours Worked on the Project:
	50 hours
##Roles:
Yoon and Eirika worked on the front end of the program, mainly the user interface.  Additionally, Yoon worked on the various Features present in the program, such as the ColorFeature, RefGridFeature, and Workspace to name a few.  Eirika primarily worked on classes that took input from the parser that was then graphically represented to the user, such as the Turtle/TurtleHandler and ImageUpdater classes.  Davis and Keng worked on the back end of the program, mainly the parser and the commands.  The backend was primarily written using JavaCC, a Java parser generator.
That being said, there was naturally some overlap in what we did, and we generally tried to help each other out when we were stuck, regardless of what part of the program we were primarily focusing on.
